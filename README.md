# EDD Java and RAG Demo
## Objective
This is a demo project that accompanies my EDD hands-on
session and shows the complete solution.
This session shows how to connect an LLM with a vectorstore
to answer questions with your own knowledge

## Prerequisites
* Java 21 
* Git
* Node JS >18 installed, NPM installed
* Optional: Docker Desktop if you want to try it as a local setup (with pgvector and ollama)
* Optional: Ollama (a bit more performant than running it in a docker container)

## Setup
* extract the cv_files.zip from [Sharepoint folder](https://erniegh-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/david_beisert_betterask_erni/Es-_6g4ai89Cj5LcHQT7T2kBiqaq9MD-5ApdtmRSW6PR2g?e=9j3nXx) 
  * to ``erni-demo-rag-backend/src/main/resources``
* copy the application.properties from from [Sharepoint folder](https://erniegh-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/david_beisert_betterask_erni/Es-_6g4ai89Cj5LcHQT7T2kBiqaq9MD-5ApdtmRSW6PR2g?e=9j3nXx) 
  * also to ``erni-demo-rag-backend/src/main/resources``
* If you want to import data into your own vector store namespace
  * Change: application.properties, ``erni.vector-store.pinecone.namespace=bedv`` to your user name so you do not overwrite my data

## Run backend
* Go to erni-demo-rag-backend/
* In the terminal execute:  ``./mvnw clean install spring-boot:run``
* Or run the class ErniDemoRagApplication from the IDE.
* You can access the swagger ui on: http://localhost:8080/swagger

## Run frontend
* got erni-demo-ui
* in the terminal execute ``npm install``
* ``npm start``
* You can access the UI on: http://localhost:4200/chat
